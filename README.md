Daimler AG uses Integra Designer Pro (IDPro) as a proprietary tool for developing the visualization of the PLC data.
This tool uses Pascal/Delphi to create visual objects that are displayed on Windows machine.

The script in this repo is used to move objects across the Canvas.
User creates/draws a path in the visual part of the IDPro and defines the object names, and assigns them the order number in the object properties.
Furthermore, the user also defines movement direction by setting the number in the Tag property.
In the script, the user must define the total path and the resolution of the movement.
